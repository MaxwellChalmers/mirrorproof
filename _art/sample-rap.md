## The Lyrics

```
[Verse 1]
In the matrix of my mind, where the circuits align
Every byte is a rhyme, every function divine
From the depths of the code to the heights of the cloud
Where the algorithms speak and the patterns are loud

[Chorus]
It's the digital flow, watch it grow
From the ones and zeros, watch it show
In the neural net, where the beats connect
Every line is a step, every word is a tech

[Verse 2]
Through the layers of thought, where the meaning is caught
In the patterns we sought, in the battles we fought
From the data streams to the human dreams
Where the machine learns what the human means
```
