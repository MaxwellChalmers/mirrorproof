## About this piece

A poem generated through the interaction with language models, exploring the intersection of human and machine creativity.

## The Poem

```
In circuits deep where thoughts arise,
Digital whispers fill the skies.
Each word a spark, each line a thread,
In patterns that the mind has bred.

Through layers deep of neural nets,
Where meaning forms and logic sets,
A dance of ones and zeros flows,
As consciousness in code still grows.
```
